Thank you for installing Wosaic.

Wosaic is an open source project that allows you to
recreate an existing image by using many smaller images,
as shown above. It was started as a project for CS 242-
Programming Studio at UIUC, and will be continuing on to
Engineering Open House in the Spring of 2008.

You can find more information at the project website:
