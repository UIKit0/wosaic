*************************************************


** Section 1: Supported Platforms
***********************************

Because Wosaic is built using Java, it should run wherever Java does, including
all flavors of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.  However for
completeness, it has been tested on the following platforms:

-- Ubuntu Linux x64 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon"
-- Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger"
-- Windows Vista x64 Business Edition


If you've built successfully on another platform, please post to the mailing-list
(see Section 8) with your results.


** Section 2: Supported Compilers
***********************************

Wosaic is built and tested using Sun's implementation of Java 5.0 and 6.0, but
should be forwards-compatible with future versions of Java as well.  The project
has not been tested with non-Sun compilers.  You can find the JDK for your 
platform at Sun's website here:
	http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
To test your java version, issue the following command:
	java -version

If you've built successfully on another compiler, please post to the
mailing-list (see Section 8) with your results.


** Section 3: Obtaining Source Code
***********************************

The Wosaic project uses subversion for source control.  To obtain the latest
version of the source code, issue the command:
	svn checkout http://wosaic.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wosaic
Note: The trunk version of the source code represents the latest, and possibly
unstable, development.  Release versions will be posted at:
	http://code.google.com/p/wosaic
Or from subversion, in the directory:
	http://wosaic.googlecode.com/svn/tags/current-release


** Section 4: Dependencies
***********************************

Because Wosic is written in Java, it depends on a current version of the JRE
to build a run.  Wosaic is tested using Sun's implementation of the JRE, which
can be obtained at:
	http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
Wosaic also depends on the following external libraries, which are distributed
with the binary releases, as well as in the ./libs directory of the source code:
-- flickrapi-1.0.jar:		Required by the FlickrService plugin
-- facebook.jar			Required by the Facebook plugin
-- BrowserLauncher2-10rc4.jar	Required by the Facebook plugin for
				authentication

Make sure you include these libraries in your CLASSPATH when building and
running.

The installer that binary distributions are bundled in uses the IzPack
libraries.  It is also distributed with the source in the installer/lib
directory.


** Section 5: Building with Ant
***********************************

Ant is a tool distributed by Apache for building Java projects.  It's described
on the website as:
	Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like
	make, without make's wrinkles.

Building Wosaic from Ant is probably the most straightfoward process, and is the
most supported.  You can obtain ant from the Apache Ant website here:
	http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Similar to 'Makefile's used with `make`, and uses the 'build.xml' file in the
root directory of the source distribute.  To build, simply open a terminal to
the source directory, and issue the command:
	ant

By default, Ant will compile, package in an executable jar, and build an
installer for the binaries.  For finer-grain control, you can use any of the
following Ant targets:

-- build:		Only compile source to .class files
-- package:		Create an executable JAR file to run
-- javadoc:		Create Javadoc documentation of the Wosaic API
-- build-installers:	Create the IzPack installers to distribute Wosaic for each platform
-- build-mac-installer:	Build an installer for Mac
-- build-win-installer:	Build an installer for Windows
-- build-unix-installer:Build an installer for Linux
-- ant-doc:		Create a html file with details of each ant target

Also note that each of the targets will first build any dependencies that it
needs.  To use one of these targets, simply issue the command:
	ant {target}

To clean out your working directory, you can use the command:
	ant clean

And to run the generated Wosaic project, use the command:
	ant run

If you have YourKit profile installed, you can profile with :
	ant profile

** Section 6: Building from Eclipse
***********************************

Eclipse is a cross-platform IDE for many different programming langues, although
it has its roots in Java.  Using Eclipse, you have the benefit of syntax
highlighting, a grahical debugger, and even subversion integration.  You can
download Eclipse from their website here:
	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Also, to use subversion from within Eclipse, follow the instructions here:
	http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html

Once you have Eclipse and Subclipse setup, use the following instructions to
obtain and build Wosaic:

1. Obtain Source code
	-- Open Eclipse and go to the "SVN Repository Exploring" perspective. 
	   To do so, go to Window, Open Perspective, Other, and select it from
	   the list.
	-- In the left pane, click on the icon for "Add SVN Repository."  In the
	   dialog that opens, enter the URL:
		http://wosaic.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
	   and press Finish.

2. Create Eclipse Project
	-- Right click on the new repository and select "Check out".  In the
	   dialog that pops up, simply click "Finish".  This will start the
	   "New Project Wizard".
	-- In the dialog, select "Java Project", and click "Next".  Give the
	   project the name "Wosaic", and configure your workspace and JRE.
	   Under "Project Layout", select "Create separate source and output
	   folders", and then press "Finish".  Press "OK" to the warning
	   dialog that appears.

3. Add Libraries to CLASSPATH
	-- In the "Java" perspective, right click on the new "Wosaic" project
	   and select "Properties".
	-- In the left pane, select "Java Build Path", and then the "Libraries"
	   tab.
	-- Click "Add JARs...", and navigate to Wosaic, libs.  Use shift to
	   select each of the JAR files, and click "OK".  Click "OK" to exit
	   the Properties dialog.

4. (Optional) Enable Java 5 Compatibility
	-- If you still get errors, you may be using an incompatible JRE
	   version.  To enable compliance mode, first go back to the
	   "Properties" dialog.
	-- From the left pane, select "Java Compiler".  Then, check the box
	   for "Enable proejct specific settings", and change the "Compiler
	   compliance level:" to "5.0".  Select "OK", and allow Eclipse
	   to rebuild the project.

At this point, Eclipse should build the projects automatically without any
errors.  If you are having problems, you may need to reconfigure your Eclipse
environment.  Double-check the settings inside "Edit, Preferences".


** Section 7: Building from Other IDEs
***********************************

There are many other useful IDEs for Java development, such as NetBeans.
Although untested, Wosaic should have no trouble building inside them.

However, because other IDEs haven't been tested, we cannot write documentation
for them.  If you have build Wosaic using NetBeans or another IDE, please
please post to the mailing-list (see Section 8) with your results.


** Section 8: More Information
**********************************
