# General usage information.

Wosaic is an application that creates mosaics out of a set of images queried from Flickr.  These images are then arranged to approximate a user-defined source image.  Usage of our app is simple:

== Usage ==

1) Specify a file to use as the source by selecting browse and choosing a valid picture file.  Currently we don't support GIF files.

2) Specify a search term for Flickr.  All the images used in the mosaic will correspond to this search term.

3) Specify a resolution.  This should be a number that roughly indicates how many images to use in the mosaic.  For example, a resolution of 25 would result in roughly 25x25 pictures used in the mosaic.

4) Press 'Genereate Mosaic.'  This button will then start the process of creating the mosaic.  Please be patient, running takes a few seconds.  Once the image has reached a stable state, you can choose to save it using the Save button.

== Issues ==

  * Currently the display is not the complete mosaic.  That is, it only shows an approximation of the result.  The entire result can be seen after doing a save.
  * In the future we will provide more options for customization.
